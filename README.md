# Image processing

Program performing some image processing operations, which includes:

- affine transformation
- entropy filtering
- closing using linear structuring element
- calculating a geodesic

All the operations were implemented from scratch. The idea of this project is to understand what's under the hood of each tool. :)

Example inputs and results can be seen in attached directories.
